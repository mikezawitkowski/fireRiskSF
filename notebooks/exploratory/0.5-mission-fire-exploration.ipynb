    "Just reading through the various articles, it seems that there's quite a bit of misinformation, and misuse of the dataset that is available for estimating fires. sf.curbed.com is saying there were 2,788 blazes in the Mission district over the full time period, but actually it's 2,788 units that were impacted. It could simply be a fact of there being a higher population density in that area, or age of buildings. There's a lot of reasons that fires could be higher in the Mission than in other parts of the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I see a huge glaring problem in trying to make estimates regarding property damage values, and that is because 90% of the data points and calls for service to the fire department have no damage estimates listed. Yes, it is true that in 2014 to 2015 the estimated property loss had doubled, but let's take a little closer look, shall we?"
